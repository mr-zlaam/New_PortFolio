              Before we dive into my awesome web dev skills, let's lay down some
              ground rules like real ones. Consider this a virtual handshake, a
              mutual understanding of what's cool and what ain't when it comes
              to our collaboration.
            </div>
            <span className="bolder">What I'm all about:</span>
            <ul className="flexing">
              <li className="regular">
                <strong>1.</strong> Bringing your digital dreams to life:
                Websites, apps, you name it. I'm like the tech genie in a code
                lamp, ready to make your visions shine online.
              </li>
              <li className="regular">
                <strong>2.</strong> Quality before everything: I ain't no shoddy
                side hustle. I polish my code like a championship trophy,
                delivering projects that work flawlessly and look slicker than a
                freshly waxed skateboard.
              </li>
              <li className="regular">
                <strong>3.</strong> Communication on point: No ghosting here.
                You'll be in the loop, every step of the way, from brainwaves to
                launch and beyond.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <div className="bolder">Now, some real talk:</div>
            <ul>
              <li className="regular">
                <strong>1.</strong> No sketchy stuff: My skills are off-limits
                for anything shady, like building websites for weapon
                trafficking or promoting illegal substances. That's a hard no,
                homie.
              </li>
              <li className="regular">
                <strong>2.</strong>Gambling gets a pass: Sorry, high rollers,
                but crafting online casinos ain't my jam. Let's keep this PG-13,
                yeah?
              </li>
              <li className="regular">
                <strong>3.</strong>Respect the copyright: Don't ask me to build
                your site on stolen content. Let's keep it original and legal,
                or risk getting slapped by the copyright police.
              </li>
